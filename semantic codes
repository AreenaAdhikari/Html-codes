            <h2>About cats</h2>
            <P>
            The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is
            the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
            domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but
            also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill
            vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
            body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social
            species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat

            Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting–as well
            as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small
            mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
